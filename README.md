# Hi, Iâ€™m @bad-Al-code ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate software developer with a focus on building scalable, cloud-native applications. I thrive on architecting complex systems from the ground up, embracing modern DevOps practices, and working across the full stack.

Currently, I'm architecting and building a **polyglot microservice e-learning platform**, which serves as my primary vehicle for mastering distributed systems, infrastructure as code, and event-driven architecture.
